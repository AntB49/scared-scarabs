# Vision and Values

## Our Vision

Our collective vision is to **be a source of light during the transitioning times on the planet**. We aim to build a decentralized application that enables community members access to a healing network of practitioners locally or remotely.

Future developments will include the ability to crowd-source projects and aid humanity in conscious ascension and planetary healing.

### How does this work?

The Healers Network will be available to all users to access healers worldwide. To be added to the Healers Network to provide services, users must actively hold at least 1 Sacred Scarab NFT.&#x20;

We are presently developing our own internal NFT marketplace as well as a project funding page where users will share their story and use their held NFTs to fund projects.&#x20;

## Our Values

### Be Compassionate

We treat everyone we encounter with compassion, seeing the humanity behind their problems and experiences.

### Be Mindful

We are intentional and aware of our thoughts, actions and manifestations. We are actively working toward a better and brighter future through our personal abilities to remain present and ever mindful.

### Transparency

We are to be as transparent as possible with any updates to code and blockchain contracts. Peer reviews will occur prior to any code pushes or updates. &#x20;
