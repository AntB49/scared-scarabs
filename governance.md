# Governance

An autonomous community is the ultimate goal of the Sacred collections.&#x20;

Once a minimum viable product has been established a new governance system will be added.

NFT and future token holders will present ideas they have to the group.

Community members will have an opportunity to vote up or down ideas within the sprint planning weeks. Once a coding sprint ends, the new top ideas on the workboard will be distributed to community programmers for implementation.

In the future, projects that the Sacred Scarabs community funds will be voted upon as a community. The vision here is to present opportunities to those who are otherwise underserved. Giving them a chance to build something great. Knowing they will pay it forward.

A governing board may also be established with rotating leadership positions. Volunteers will be added to a voting cycle for each of the roles.&#x20;

Positions should not be held for more than 2 consecutive cycles and additional community members should be actively training so that they may participate as a volunteer.

Rotating leadership will allow for new voices to be heard and new ideas to be shared from those who would otherwise sit back.
