# Sacred Collection NFT Rarities

The intention behind the art of the 8 Sacred collections was for the creator to represent his love for God through a digital medium.

The number of collections, 8, was intentionally chosen to represent the infinite potential of Source. Each collection is unique and varies.

### Sacred Spiders

The Sacred collections began with Sacred Spiders. Sitting in meditation on a mountain in Southern California, I was hit with divine inspiration.

"If You would have me create something. What would you have me Create?" I asked God inside my heart.

"Me." I heard. "Express your love for me through art."

This is how the design for the Sacred Spiders came into existence. I then began asking myself how I would represent God if I could.

The 5 Variations of Sacred symbols were chosen to represent God's love for us all and a Divine unity that exists between all creeds and cultures.

The probability of all 4 of the same symbols occurring in the corners is quite low. The 5 versions of 4 corner pieces also have lower probabilities. Which is the most rare?

The 7 different color variations in the backgrounds of the image represent the 7 chakras and their role in connecting us to Divine wisdom. There are 2 variances for each chakra. Does collecting all 7 have a benefit?

The sacred geometry patterns that occur within the image are a representation of the mathematical precision of the Universe. God is a magnificent programmer. As above so below. The fractal representation of the holographic universe.

The Spider. My deepest childhood fear. When deciding on the main subject I chose to represent God's love for me through my ability to overcome the most challenging spiritual battle. Fear.

The spider also represented a traumatic childhood memory that was pivotal in realizing God's love for me and ultimately my trust in Him.
